#### Division of Labor

All group members contributed equally. Note that the GitHub commit history is slightly off and that code is all contained in main branch since we built off each others’ work.
- **Michelle**: Preprocessed and split training/validation/test data, conducted exploratory analysis, developed multiple visualizations, completed data augmentation
- **Amelia**: Defined DenseNet model, ran training/validation/test datasets, developed training/validation loss and accuracy graphs, calculated metrics
- **Jennifer**: Defined VGGNet model, ran training/validation datasets, developed training/validation loss and accuracy graphs, calculated metrics
- **Deva**: Created GitHub repo, explored optimizations, ran optimizations on both DenseNet and VGGNet models, and created GradCam visualizations
- **All**: Debugging on Discord, looking over each others’ work and offering improvements
